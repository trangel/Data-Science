<h2>Documentation for test suite:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Test 1.</b> Test provided by insights.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Test 2.</b> Test for command line arguments.
  Input/Output file names are passed as command line arguments.
  This tests that command line arguments correctly work.
  <li> <b>Test 3.</b> Test for user network.
  For a network of degree 2 (D=2), the algorithm prints out the user network.
  Only "befriend" and "unfriend" events appear. 
  This tests the functions for adding and removing users/friends from the network.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Test 4.</b> Test for history-of-purchases database.
  A small database of purchases is constructed and printed out at the end.
  This tests that the database is correctly built and sorted, i.e., at end entries should be ordered by timeframe and order of appearance. 
  </li>
  <li> <b>Test 5.</b> Test for purchase statistics.
  A small database is constructed. 
  At the end, for a given set of purchases, the mean and standard deviation are printed out.
  This checks that statistics correct, i.e., it tests routines to evaluate purchase statistics.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Test 6.</b> Tests for performance in a larger database.
  A database of few thousands of records is built.
  This test can serve to check performance of the algorigthm. 
  Execution time is output for these means.
  </li>
</ul>
