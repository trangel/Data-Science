## Content recommender
This is part of the CDIPS Data Science 2017 Workshop.   
This project makes use of generic data science tools: data extraction/cleaning, web scraping, natural language processing, machine learning models, web servers, using flask to query SQLite databases, and A/B testing to validate our recommender.

## User network graph
A user network graph in python.
I keep track of purchases and tag anoumalous events.
See [<a href="https://github.com/trangel/Data-Science/tree/master/tracking-purchases"> graph </a>].
